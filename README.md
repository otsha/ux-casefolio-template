# UX Casefolio Template

A responsive template for case study heavy portfolios, built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com). I guess you could also use it as a blog with some tweaks! ðŸ˜… 

## Running Locally

0. You should have Node.js & npm installed.

1. (Optional) fork this repository if you'd like to use git for version control.

2. Clone or download the repository and navigate to its root

3. Install the required dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

4. Create a new file named `.env` and add environment variables for the site's title and copyright information

```env
SITE_NAME=My Cool Portfolio
COPYRIGHT_NAME=My Name
COPYRIGHT_YEAR=2025
```

5. Run the application in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Editing Portfolio Contents

### Title & Footer

You can edit the site title, as well as the copyright information by updating the `.env` file.

### Custom Favicon, Hero and Profile Images

Place these in the `public/` directory at the root of the repository.

- The `favicon` should be a `png` file, and it's recommended to keep small in size. If you'd like to use another image type / filename, you can edit the site's `<head>` in `src/layouts/DefaultLayout.astro`.
- The `hero` image should be a `jpg` file. It is displayed on the index page and takes up the entire screen by default. You can change the file path in `src/components/Hero.astro` if you'd like to use, say, `webp` (which I would generally recommend due to smaller file size).
- The `profile` image should be a `jpg` file as well. It is displayed on the index page in the "About" section. You can change the file path in `src/components/AboutSection.astro`.

### About Section

The about section HTML can be edited in `src/components/AboutSection.astro`.

### Editing Cases

The cases are an [Astro content collection](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) located in `src/content/cases`. The configuration can be found in `src/content/content.config.js` and the rendering component in `src/pages/cases/[slug].astro`.

Editing the case files is simple. You can use Markdown to format your cases. Each `.md` file in the `src/content/cases` directory corresponds to a case. All cases in the directory are automatically displayed on the index page under the "Cases" section (using `src/components/CaseSection.astro`).

The frontmatter of each case should have a title and a path to a cover image that will be displayed in the case section on the index page and as a hero image on the case page. The cover image should be placed in the `public/` directory at the root of the repository, but further directory structure is up to you.

e.g.
```md
---

title: My Design Case Study
coverImage: /img/cases/case-1-hero.png

---

# My Design Case Study

Write your content here!

You can also use lists:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

...and images in the `public/` directory:

![](/img/cases/case-1-design-demo.png)

Markdown files can also utilize HTML and Tailwind classes if you need further customization!

<p class="text-red-600">Like this!</p>
```

### External Links

You can add external links to the navigation bar by updating `src/components/Nav.astro`. There's already an example of an external link. You can simply use the `Navlink` component.

### Styling

The application is mostly using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) to style each component individually. Additionally, some global styling (font, root element styling, text formatting) is provided in `src/global.css`. Feel free to customize in your preferred way. 

> Note that you can also use HTML and tailwind classes within your case `.md` files, if you need to style something specific!

## Deployment

If you use Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, Heroku or Vercel you should be able to simply connect the repo and deploy. See the Astro [docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) for more info.

For custom deployments, the build command is `npm run build` / `astro build`. The built static site is then located in the `dist/` folder.

> **The build command does not optimize any images for web.** Make sure to use optimized images to reduce your bandwidth. I'd generally recommend using `webp` images and pushing the file size as small as possible without decimating the quality. If your cases contain a lot of images, insert them as HTML and make use of [lazy loading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading#images_and_iframes)!
