## Case 1

This is where you'd write up your case study. You can just use markdown! And by that, I mean that you *can* use most (I **think**) formatting options, too!

See, here's an image:

![](/cases/case-2/case-2.jpg)

You can also do lists!

- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3
- and so on...

### Extending Markdown with HTML

However, if something doesn't seem to work quite right, don't fret! The spec includes support for HTML, and, with that, you may also use all the Tailwind styles you want (since it's included in package.json).

<p class="text-red-600">Like this!</p>

<div class="p-4 bg-sky-600 rounded-[25px] shadow-inner text-center">
... or like this!
</div>
